# Butterfly Effect Game

A narrative-driven, choice-based game where every decision matters and shapes the story's outcome. Inspired by games like "Until Dawn," this project focuses on character relationships, exploration, and branching storylines.

## Core Concepts

- **Butterfly Effect Focus**: Every choice impacts the story
- **Exploration-Driven Narrative**: Discover clues and resources through exploration
- **Character Relationships**: Characters with intertwined histories whose fates depend on player choices
- **Multiple Endings**: Various outcomes based on cumulative decisions
